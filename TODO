Improve I2C-code 
- Check all high/low bits
- Change SDA/SCL high to release (set as input)
- Timeouts if SCL for some reason gets stuck low
- Add code for clock stretching


General
- Add timestamp to arduino host to all reads
- Make arduino NOT reset when opening serial line?
- Measure current consumption of temp nodes
- Clean up code and comment
